Instead of a bookmark, this looks interesting enough to have forked. ;)

# Upstream:

Bare metal STM32F4 examples to serve as starting points for projects. Educational purposes.

Some of the STM32F4xx family based processor headers are added in the `include` folder to get register locations. CMSIS library is added for a general support. No extra HAL libraries is used except the selected projects described below.

Common startup functions are located in the `include/startup_stm32f407vgtx.s` and `include/system_stm32f4xx.c` files to be included in all projects.

## Installation

First, clone the project using `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/fcayci/stm32f4-bare-metal`. The repository includes other repositories such as `CMSIS` as submodules under `lib` folder. You can alternatively clone the repository, then initialize and update the submodules with `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` commands.

## Development

There are two options for development. First one is to use [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html) from ST. Second one is the setup your own development environment. Both options are supported with relevant project settings or makefiles.

### Option 1 - STM32CubeIDE

- Download and install [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html). Select workspace on the root folder, then import existing projects to workspace. (File -> Import -> General -> Existing Projects into Workspace)
- You do not need any additional tools. It comes with the compiler and debugger pre-installed.
- Rest of the sections are for Option 2.

### Option 2 - Custom development environment

- Get **toolchain** (for compiler and binutils) from [GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads)
- *For windows only*, install **make** tool. You can just get the make tool from [gnuwin32](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm). Alternatively you can install the minimalist GNU tools for windows from [mingw](https://mingw-w64.org/) and [MSYS](https://www.msys2.org/)
- For the **programmer/debugger**, you can use - [stlink](https://github.com/texane/stlink) or [OpenOCD](http://openocd.org/). Though only stlink utility support is added.
- You can use your favorite code editor to view/edit the contents. Here is an open source one: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

#### Compile

[makefile](projects/armf4.mk) contains necessary build scripts and compiler flags for all projects. Individual settings can be changed from local makefiles from projects such as [blinky makefile](projects/blinky/makefile)

Browse into any directory and run `make` to compile.

```
cd projects/blinky
make
```

If everything is setup correctly, you should see the completed message.
```
Cleaning blinky
Building blinky.c
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
    852	      8	   1568	   2428	    97c	blinky.elf
Successfully finished...
```

If you see any errors about command not found, make sure the toolchain binaries are in your `PATH`. On Windows check the *Environment Variables* for your account. On Linux/macOS run `echo $PATH` to verify your installation.

#### Program

Run `make burn` to program the chip.
```
...
.. Flash written and verified! jolly good!
```

Install the [ST LINK](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/st-link-v2.html) drivers if you cannot see your board when `make burn` is run.

#### Disassemble

Run `make disass` / `make disass-all` to disassamble.

#### Debug

In order to debug your code, connect your board to the PC, run `st-util` (comes with stlink utility) from one terminal, and from another terminal within the project directory run `make debug`. You can then use general **gdb** commands to browse through the code.
